# Operators --> Operators are used to do Operations
# Arithmatic Operations
#Relational Operations
# Logiacl Operations

# Arithmatic Operations:

a = 5
b = 2

add = a+b
sub = a-b
mul = a*b
div = a/b
mod = a//b
per = a%b
power = a**b

print(add) # +  Represents Addition
print(sub)
print(mul) # Multiplication
print(div) # Division
print(mod)  # Quotient
print(per)  # remainder
print(power) # Power

# Relational Operators: returns a boolean value
# > < >= <= != --> Comparision Operators

a = 10
b = 20

print(a>b)
print(a<b)
print(a==b)
print(a>=b)
print(a<=b)
print(a!=b)

# Logical Operators : Gives integer values
# and or not

a = 10
b = 20

print(a and b)
print(a or b)
# print(a not b)
