Data Types
***********
Strings
Numeric--> int ,float
Sequence Datatypes--> List,Tuple
Mapping 
Boolean

Syntax : How you are writing the data types

Inbuilt Functions:
------------------
Split Function--> 
    Separate the String into two parts and makes its as list 
    [1,2,3]

String Inbuilt Functions:
    Split()
    Upper()
    Lower()
    isDigit()
    isNumeric()
Keywords:
    There are 26 keywords:
    
Varibales:
    Global Variables 
    Local Variables
Naming Convention:
   1) Always Declare Varibles in lower case Letetrs
   2) Use Underscore in beteen two words(Snake Casing)
   3) Use digits in between the words 
   4) Camel Casing --> Declare Each starting word is Capital
   5) Descriptive as possible

Formatting the output:
    Using f infront of the double Quotes inside the print statement is 
    print(f"The statements : {varible_name}")
