Object Oriented Programming Language: OOPS
 Python is Structure and Object Oriented

OOPs Concepts:
  Class 
  Objects
  Inheritance
  Polymorphism
  Overloading

Class:  A Class is a collection of variable and methods 
  A group of objects represented in a single entity is called Class
  a "blueprint" for creating objects.
  Collections of Variables(attributes)  and Methods(Behavoir)
  Logical Entity
  Does Not occupy space in the memory 
Objets:
  It occupies space in the memory 
  An instance of the class
  It is a Physical Entity
for one class we can create multiple ojects but ojects are independent of each other 

Methods: (Functions)

Ouside Class: we call it as Function
  def <function-name> ()
        name = "peddireddy"
        print(name)

Method : A function creating inside a class is called Methods

class 

There are : 2 : # Type of Methods can declare inside the class

1: Static Method (We can call directly call using the class)
  To make the method static we need to mention  : @staticMethod  
2: Instance Method (we can call the function through object)

Types of Variables: 
  1: Class Variables
  2: Global Variables
  3: Local Variables

# Variables : Local,Class,Global
To Access Class variables we need to use self.variablename

self.<variablename> : --> Class variables to access inside class

Method   VS   Constructor :

Method we can give any name 
Method will return values
Method can take the arguments and parameters
Methods can be invoking using objects

Constructor name should be def __init__(self)
Constructor will never return the Value
Constructor can also take arguments and Parameters
Contructor will be called at the time of object Creation

Constructor: As same a class to used for classes

__init__(self): This is a Contructor 

Inheritance: 
  Taking the Features and Funtionalities from the parent class.

  Inheritance Concept:
    Acquiring all the attributes (Variables) and Behaviour(Methods) from one class to another class is called inheritance
  
Class A : a,b,c m1(),m2() Base Class,Parent Class, Derived Class
Class B(A) : x, y, z m3() Sub Class, Derived Class

Objectives of Inheritance:
  1: Code Re-Usability
  2: Avoid Duplication
  3: Multi-Level Inheritance 
  4: Multiple Inheritance ( Multiple Parents)
  5: Heirarchy Inheritance
Type of Inheritance:
  1: Single Inheritance
  2: Multiple Inheritance
  3: Multi-Level Inheritance
  4: Heirarchy Inheritance

Over Loading: (Polymorphism)
  On method can be defined in many froms.
  One method can be callled many times 
  Same Method name but different Parameters

Modules :
  A Collections of Functions, Classes (Variables + Methods)
Packages :
  A Collections of Modules is called Packages

How To create a Module
How to call the functions from one module to another module
Same Functions in multiple Modules

Exception Handing : Program Errors : Syntax Error:
  An Event which will cause a Program Termination
  While Executing the program it will show some error

try ,except,else, finally
try: it will try to execute the code
except: if try block got error then this except code will work
else: if Except block doesn't execute then it will get executed
finally: will execute every time 


File Handling:
  Working with text
  Writing data into text files
